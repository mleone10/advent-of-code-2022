# Advent of Code 2022
> Solutions to 2022's Advent of Code event

This year, I'm back to Go as I approach AoC with a focus on testing and reusable code.  Some goals:
* Test-driven approach - rather than many executables and `main` packages, I'll try to run each solution using a iteratively-developed testing library.
* Generics - if the opportunity presents itself, I'll experiment with Go generics to simplify common operations.
* Reusable code - so many of AoC's puzzles use the same underlying datastructures and methods, so I'll work on creating a versatile toolbox of ones I can use again and again.
